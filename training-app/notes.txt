ANGULAR JS TUTORIAL

Model = is what defines our data
View = what users see

Dependency Injection : giving a function an object, rather than creating a object inside a function , you pass it to the function.

All angular js services start with a dollar sign ($)

$scope = is a object, that you can add variables and functions too.

$scope is a service that is apart of the core angular module

Interpolation: creating a string by combining strings and placeholders.

Directive: an instruction to angularjs to manipulate a piece of the dom

Two-way Data Binding: when the view updates the model, and the model updates the view.



WATCHERS AND DIGEST

On top of the javascript event loop we have the angular context that watches. 

Watchlist: every time you put binding, interpolation, variable , or function thats is on the scope to the html page. Angular adds a watcher.
The part of it watching, and checking for changes is inside the digest loop or digest cycle. 
When you enter into a digest cycle, it asks the question has something changed. If something has changed it updates everything thats connected to it.
